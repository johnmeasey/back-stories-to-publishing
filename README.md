## About the book
As biologists we are used to seeing lots of fantastic papers being successfully published in journals all the time. But we know from bitter experience that our manuscripts may go through many rejections from different journals before finally going into print. Sharing the success is sweet, but this book is about reflecting on the road to that success. This is an opportunity for those who have battled through rejections and difficult reviewers and who have finally overcome. It is written for an audience of Early Career Scientists (and anyone else) who needs the inspiration to keep revising and submitting their manuscripts in order reach their publishing goal.
