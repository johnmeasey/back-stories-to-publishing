description: "As biologists we are used to seeing lots of fantastic papers being successfully published in journals all the time. But we know from bitter experience that our manuscripts may go through many rejections from different journals before finally going into print. Sharing the success is sweet, but this book is about reflecting on the road to that success. This is an opportunity for those who have battled through rejections and difficult reviewers and who have finally overcome. It is written for an audience of Early Career Scientists (and anyone else) who needs the inspiration to keep revising and submitting their manuscripts in order reach their publishing goal."

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Sharing our successes and forgetting how we got there is not a true
reflection of the pains that many successful biologists go through when
publishing. The idea of this book is to openly share the struggle behind
the successes in many different published papers in the Biological
Sciences. In doing so, I hope that this book will represent a reflective
experience for those who author chapters about their work, in order to
look for the positive in what might otherwise be regarded as a
thoroughly negative experience. For those who read, this shared
community of practice should represent an insight into the failures that
everyone goes through - even though you might only see the success. In
addition, I hope that you can learn some tricks of our trade, in order
to better prepare you for your own publishing journey. Perhaps most
importantly, I want this book to provide some inspiration for those of
you who feel that you might want to give up. Publishing your work is
very important, we all want you to succeed, but sometimes you will need
to persevere in order to make the most of your research.

# Requirements for contributors {.unnumbered}

If you want to contribute to this book, there are a few requirements:

1.  You must have published the paper that your story is about, and
    provide a link to the paper, and if possible the online reviews

2.  You should have been the principle author and/or certainly the
    corresponding author

3.  This should have been an important paper for you personally, and
    preferably have some importance for others in your field. If it's
    not been a big deal for you, then it's not likely to make a good
    **back story**

4.  Use the first person singular pronoun to tell your story

5.  This is not an opportunity for *ad hominem* attacks, so please avoid
    names of individuals

6.  Make it personal about you and please do share your feelings. We
    want to know about the low times, but we also want to know what
    helped you through them

7.  Use the exercise as an opportunity to reflect on your experience,
    and provide ideas that might help others who are faced with similar
    situation

8.  Promote solutions. We know that the current world of publishing is
    not ideal. Provide some ideas for what you think might have worked
    in your situation

# Formula for contributors {.unnumbered}

As long as you meet all of the [requirements](#requirements) above,
there is no compulsory formula, and you are welcome to write your story
in your way. If you want some pointers of how you could structure your
chapter, then please see the outline below:

-   Introduction: Tell us a little about you at the time that the study,
    and the write-up took place:

    -   what stage of your career were you at

    -   where in the world were you

    -   what was your home story at the time

    -   anything else that we need to know in order to appreciate your
        feelings and attachment to the study itself

-   Back-story to the study: Briefly outline what the study was about:

    -   the approach & ideas

    -   time taken to collect the data

    -   the other co-authors

    -   anything else relevant to understand the completion of the study
        and its write-up

-   The first submission

    -   where did it go

    -   how long did it take

    -   what was the outcome

    -   what did you learn

-   The second submission

    -   see the first submission

-   Repeat until accepted

-   Reflect on your experience:

    -   What were the major changes that you made to the manuscript
        between the first submission and acceptance

    -   Who made the difference between the rejections and acceptance of
        your paper and what did they do?

    -   What were the major lessons that you learned, and how has this
        changed your approach to publishing moving forwards?

    -   What advice can you give to Early Career Researchers who might
        be in the middle of their biggest publishing story, but not at
        the point where they have had their manuscript accepted?

-   If you can, provide a picture or two that adds something personal to
    the story

# Send me your chapters {.unnumbered}

You can send chapters directly to me at
[john\@measey.com](john@measey.com), or DM me on Twitter
[\@AfriHerp](https://twitter.com/afriherp). This book will be published
[Open
Access](https://johnmeasey.github.io/How-to-publish-in-Biological-Sciences/openaccess1.html)
online using [Bookdown](bookdown.org) [@bookdown2016]. I will lightly
edit chapters prior to posting them. If you want to make it as easy as
possible, write your chapter in RMarkdown [@rmarkdown2018], and please
send any citations in BibTex format.

If the book gets interesting, we can approach a publisher, but it should
always remain Open Access.
