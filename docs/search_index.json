The idea of this book is to openly share the struggle behind the successes in many different published papers in the Biological Sciences. In doing so, I hope that this book will represent a reflective experience for those who author chapters about their work, in order to look for the positive in what might otherwise be regarded as a thoroughly negative experience. For those who read, this shared community of practice should represent an insight into the failures that everyone goes through - even though you might only see the success. In addition, I hope that you can learn some tricks of our trade, in order to better prepare you for your own publishing journey. Perhaps most importantly, I want this book to provide some inspiration for those of you who feel that you might want to give up.

Their paper was exciting, they were using a phylogenetic approach to show that amphibians, without any doubt, had dispersed over marine barriers. I was fascinated, as at the time I had just come back from one such island with a set of endemic amphibian species. I settled down to read the paper and was enthused to see what they would say about my study site, and the amphibians it contained. But the paper didnt mention them. In fact, before the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, it even denied that their existence: One important argument for such interpretations, ever since Darwin (1859), has been that heretoforth no endemic amphibians were known from oceanic islands. - Vences et al. (2003) The rest of the study was very nice. They went on to explain how they could show that a group of amphibians had crossed an oceanographic barrier. But for me, I was stuck on that first paragraph and that they had completely overlooked my study site when I thought that everyone knew about it. After all, if I knew about it, then surely this group of distinguished German researchers should know? It was 2003, and I was a Marie-Curie Fellow at Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) stationed at Bondy near Paris. I had already been there 18 months following a couple of short post-docs in South Africa and Brazil. But my fellowship wasnt going particularly well. I had visited the island of São Tomé on the recommendation of Bob Drewes (CalAcad), who Id known for a number of years. Bob had spent nearly an entire conference banging on about São Tomé and how excellent it was, and how easy it was to find my study organisms: caecilian amphibians. FIGURE 1.1: A combination of events started the ball rolling on this manuscript. The publication of Vences et al. (2003), indoctrination from Bob Drewes about São Tomé, and my visits there in search of the cobra bobo (Schistometopum thomense). I emailed Bob, sent him a copy of Vences et al. (2003) and asked how it was possible that they had forgotten about São Tomé, and what were we going to do about setting the record straight. Bob fired straight back that we should contact Vences and ask why they hadnt included the (then) five known endemic species living on the island. Further, we asked whether Miguel would be interested in participating in a paper setting the record straight: that the endemic amphibians of São Tomé had undisputedly colonised the island by crossing a marine barrier, and that this had been (implicitly) known (although admittedly not explicitly stated) for more than 100 years (Bocage 1873). São Tomé is one in a chain of volcanic islands (~13 Mya) in the Gulf of Guinea with minimum distances of at least 220 km from mainland Africa. The amphibians had been described since the mid-19th century, and their endemism had never been disputed. There followed some discussion and a delay while I went to Amsterdam to meet Miguel and sequence tissue that Bob had collected from an endemic frog (Ptychadena newtoni) from São Tomé. From this point on, what had been intended as a simple reply to Vences et al. (2003) became something far more complex and interesting. I had met oceanographers at IRD who worked in the Gulf of Guinea, and discussed ideas relating to the colonisation events of these islands. Bernad Bourles data on oceanic currents and surface salinity was self-evident when put in this context. Lastly, Martim Melo was studying birds of the Cameroon line, and his expert knowledge about the island endemics was superlative - hence a comprehensive argument could be included about why the frogs had not been carried to the islands by birds. 1.1 Submitting the manuscript The manuscript was finally finished and written up for Biology Letters as it proposed a new explanation about how it was possible for amphibians to cross saltwater barriers using freshwater paths. I was proud of the paper, and I was sure that it was appropriate for Biology Letters. It was submitted in September 2004, and it did get reviewed. One review was favourable, and the other pointed out four putative weaknesses, and suggested that for the paper to be more than conjecture some of these should be strongly supported in order make the paper convincing. I appealed. I wrote a long explanation as to how in fact the manuscript already tackled three out of the four points convincingly, and that the fourth could at least be given a high probability. I have no record of whether or not the appeal was even considered. Presumably not. So I was resigned to picking out another journal. Discussion ensued, and we decided on Journal of Biogeography. This required re-writing the manuscript as a full paper, but on reflection this also allowed me to pull in a lot more of my reading into the manuscript and more convincingly address the points raised by Reviewer #2 from our Biology Letters submission. The new manuscript was submitted to Journal of Biogeography early in 2005, and once again it was reviewed. The reviews took a long time. I think I must have written and asked about it as the decision email started with an apology. This time the reviewers were not short and punchy, but very long, asking for a substantial rewrite, and more sequencing of the specimens to produce a more convincing phylogeny. My fellowship had ended and I was unemployed. Still working on manuscripts as well as funding applications, job applications and all those other occupations that make the life of an unemployed Early Career Researcher so much more painful and unfulfilling than those in work. Discussions about the reviews ensued, and it was decided that we needed to do the additional sequencing to produce the new phylogeny, and that this could be done by a new postgraduate of Miguels, Ylenia Chiari, while I got to work rewriting and responding to the text. This was a real low point for me. I had a crisis in confidence as I was an inexperienced researcher trying to head up an important paper with much more senior scientists and fellow ECRs as co-authors. What did they think of how I was handling the manuscript? Had I imagined the importance of this work? Should I rather hand the manuscript over to someone with more experience? At the same time, the slow progress on this manuscript was impeding momentum on my career. I really wanted to be able to have this as a completed project. Lastly, I had that nagging doubt that someone, maybe even the reviewers, would publish on this subject before me. Many people had now seen this idea, and they all had access to similar resources that could provide similar lines of evidence. It was an uncomfortable time during which I came to believe that the manuscript would never be published. That hiatus of doubt, sequencing and rewriting might have lasted as long as a year to 18 months. At long last, the sequencing and reanalysis was done and the manuscript rewritten with the extensive reviewer comments addressed. the manuscript was again ready to submit and send back to Journal of Biogeography. More time passed. This time we managed to get a decision of Minor Revision, but the reviewers wanted us to change the title of the manuscript. They didnt like Freshwater Paths and I felt heartbroken because this was at the crux of the manuscript, the idea that enough freshwater was exiting the Congo River in a very large plume that would lower sea-surface salinity all the way to the Gulf of Guinea islands. Under duress, I changed the title. Happily for me, the Journal of Biogeography handling editor was Bob McDowell. Bob liked the title and urged me to change it back again. He also had quite a lot of suggestions to improve the readability of the text. Suddenly, I felt as if I was turning the corner on this manuscript. An editor liked it and was prepared to make sure that it was as good as it could be before going to print. It did shuttle forwards and backwards again a few times between myself and the Journal of Biogeography editorial team, but by then I had the feeling that it would all come out ok. Things were also looking up for me as I had a new postdoc starting. The paper was published in 2007: Measey et al. (2007). FIGURE 1.2: Time spent on São Tomé also had its ups and downs. My field assistant Quintino Quade celebrates our fantastic haul of caeclians, after a day spent digging in the rain in the islands forested interior. 1.2 Looking back At the time, I would have been happy had the manuscript been accepted in Biology Letters, but it would not have been nearly as good as the manuscript that was accepted at the Journal of Biogeography. The reviewers that I was convinced were trying to make life as difficult as possible for the manuscript, had made it a lot better. I think that the editors of the Journal of Biogeography had made a huge difference in their commitment to getting a good manuscript for their journal. The payoff has been that this has been one of my best cited papers over the years, and its a publication that Im proud of. It introduced me to a better way of collaboration over antagonism when responding to an error made by colleagues, and it resulted in lots of connections with people from other disciplines that I would not have otherwise met. The study has inspired others too. Ive had a bunch of different undergraduates telling me that they read the paper as a part of their course, and enjoyed it (something that doesnt happen too often). In addition, the study became the subject of a chapter in a popular book about biogeography by Alan de Queroz (2014): The Monkeys Voyage: How Improbable Journeys Shaped the History of Life. References "],["no-mussels-in-patches.html", "Chapter 2 No mussels in patches 2.1 Figure out how to handle rejections 2.2 The hard part", " Chapter 2 No mussels in patches Dave Strayer Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, New York, U.S.A. Every so often, you hear about that mythological creature, the scientist who has never had a paper rejected. Most of us, though, begin to accumulate rejections as soon as we begin to submit papers. I myself have been rejected by ~20 different journals, from Science to the Northeastern Naturalist. Ive gotten rude reviews, kind reviews, superficial reviews, insightful reviews, and just-plain-wrong reviews. Editors have made fair decisions about most of my papers, but have rejected some of my best papers, and accepted some papers that probably needed work. Not surprisingly, its the rejections, rather than the easy passes, that we authors remember. Each rejected paper has its own story. Ive chosen to tell the story of what I think of as one of my best papers (Strayer 1999), which was soundly rejected, twice. Freshwater mussels are distributed very patchily in streams (Fig. 1 bottom panels); some small patches on the streambed contain lots of mussels, but large areas support few or no mussels. Previous papers (e.g. Strayer and Ralley 1993) had shown that conventional explanations for local distribution of stream macroinvertebrates (e.g., current speed, sediment grain size) failed to account for mussel distribution. I had the idea that local differences in disturbance severity and frequency might account for mussel distributions. Mussels are long-lived (typically 5-50 years, Haag 2012) compared to the frequency of floods strong enough to move stream sediments (floods typically mobilize stream sediments every 1-2 years). Maybe mussels live on little bits of the streambed that are stable during floods. I thought that we could test this idea by marking stones on the streambed, waiting for a flood, and seeing whether the marked stones survived in the mussel patches but were swept away elsewhere. My faithful assistants marked and set out thousands of stones into two small rivers with mapped patches of mussels  so much work! As luck would have it, we got big floods the first winter, and the results strongly supported our idea  we recovered marked rocks in the mussel beds but few elsewhere (Fig. 1). I thought this was a really good study - so I wrote it up and sent it to Freshwater Biology. The journal flatly rejected it  not revise and resubmit, not send to a different journal, but reject. The criticisms all looked either wrong or addressable to me. One reviewer objected to the absence of statistical testing of what I thought was an obvious match of rock and mussel distributions, so I invented what I thought was a nifty new statistical test (independently proposed by Roxburgh and Chesson 1998) and added it to the paper. I thought that the paper was even better, and a good match to the journal, so I wrote back to the editor, asking him to reconsider the paper. He agreed, and the revised paper went out to review, only to be once again rejected. This might have been a good point to give up on the paper, or at least radically rework it. But even with the benefit of two sets of negative reviews and editors comments, I still thought that this paper was fundamentally sound, so I revised it once more, and sent it to the Journal of the North American Benthological Society. They accepted it after minor revision and published it without incident. The paper has been a modest success, with 281 cites on Google Scholar and 131 cites on Web of Science, as of 21 Aug 2021. Gratifyingly, citation rates have been rising, with the highest citation rates yet occurring 20 years after publication. I flatter myself into thinking that perhaps this twice-rejected paper has thus either inspired or anticipated mussel research over the past couple of decades. 2.1 Figure out how to handle rejections If youre an academic researcher, your proposals and papers are going to get rejected, fairly or unfairly, so you should figure out how to handle and even benefit from rejections, rather than stewing over them and letting them harm your life and career. Here are a few things that have helped me. Ive learned that its always worth thinking carefully about the feedback that you get, even if it is harshly negative. Reviews often include good advice for improving your paper (like adding that statistical test). If a review contains criticism that is off-base or wrong, Ive learned to ask myself whether poor communication on my part, and not just stupidity on the reviewers part, might have led to the unwarranted criticism. Ive been dismayed at how often Ive found unclear writing when I went back to look at a criticized paper. Better communicating your results and ideas can keep future readers from making the same mistake that the reviewer did. Finally, Ive learned that its ok to reject and ignore criticisms that are unfair or irrelevant  reviewers are not always right! But you should reach this conclusion only after you have carefully thought about the reviews, with as open a mind as is possible. As a corollary to this, I learned never to write a response to reviews or resubmit a paper right after I get the reviews, when Im still hot and most want to write that response. Now, I read the reviews, put everything aside for a week, then get to the hard work of deciding how to respond. Ive learned not to give up on a rejected paper if Im convinced of its value, even after negative reviews. Some of my favorite papers were first rejected (e.g. Strayer and Malcom 2006; Strayer 1983, 2020, 1999 and more; Strayer, Hattala, and Kahnle 2004), but I was able to use what I learned from these initial rejections to improve the papers and publish them, sometimes in a better journal. Ive learned that once a paper has been rejected by a journal, its probably best to move on to another journal, rather than persisting with the first journal. I have heard of cases where a journal reversed a decision about rejection, but its rare, and it never happened to me. More often, going back to the original journal led to further delays and frustration. There are plenty of good journals for your work. 2.2 The hard part The hard part, which I still struggle with, is knowing whether to listen to expert voices saying that your work is flawed or worthless, or to your inner voice saying that your work is good or important. Critics, even eminent ones, can be wrong, and we all know of examples where only an authors persistence saved a great piece of work from oblivion. James Joyce sent his Dubliners, now considered to be one of the greatest short story collections in the English language, 18 times to 15 different publishers over a nine-year period before it was finally published. So maybe your rejected work really is good (though probably not as good as Dubliners), and you should revise and resubmit it as many times as it takes to get funded or published. On the other hand, I know of plenty of examples in which a scientist (sometimes me!) wasted a lot of time pushing a stale or flawed idea that didnt deserve to be published. Its easy to overvalue the novelty and importance of your own work. Pursuing a bad or mediocre manuscript can waste time that you dont have to waste as an early career scientist, and harm your reputation among colleagues. I can offer only two suggestions to help you balance your inner voice and the outer critics. First, if you can, find out whether you tend to overvalue or undervalue your own work. This can help you decide whether you need to adjust the volume of your inner voice up or down. Second, try to find one or a few people who have the good judgement, good will, and time to serve as an honest critic of your ideas. Such people are hard to find, but can be invaluable, especially if you can keep them over the course of your career. But in the end, you will need to make your own hard decisions about whether the negative critics are right, and when to give up or sink more time into rejected proposals and papers. References "],["doing-things-the-old-way.html", "Chapter 3 Doing things the old way 3.1 Submitting the manuscript 3.2 Looking back", " Chapter 3 Doing things the old way Brian van Wilgen Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa Back in the late 1970s, I was an MSc student working on a thesis about the effects of fire in fynbos vegetation; a biodiverse heathland vegetation endemic to South Africas southwestern region. I was employed by the Department of Forestry, and based at the Jonkershoek Forestry Research Centre near Stellenbosch, South Africa. It was a time when the Department was about to embark on an ambitious program to introduce prescribed burning to vast areas of mountain fynbos, and they needed scientific studies to provide a basis for knowing how often, and when, to burn. It was an exciting period to be a researcher in this field, because at that time the entire collection of scientific papers about the ecology of fynbos could be stored in a single small folder. It was also conventional to write a thesis as a single, stand-alone document, but universities were beginning to experiment with the idea of preparing each chapter as a paper that could be submitted to a journal for publication. Consequently, I was advised to follow this route. My study examined the effects of frequency of burning on fynbos vegetation. I used three sites to compare outcomes  one that was burnt every four years, one that burnt every 20 years or so, and one that had been protected from fire for 37 years. I had two potentially publishable papers in my thesis, one that dealt with the botanical composition of the sites, and one with the above-ground biomass. My research confirmed that burning at four-year intervals eliminated tall proteas (family Proteaceae), reducing the vegetation to a short stature with low biomass. Burning every 20 years resulted in stands of healthy proteas, with much more above-ground biomass. Protection from fire for longer periods resulted in the proteas becoming senescent, with excessive amounts of dead, dry material above ground. At the time, it was policy that all research done in the department had to be published in the South African Forestry Journal, which was not rigorously peer-reviewed. My academic supervisor, Dr Eugene Moll at UCT, thought that the biomass paper would be suitable for an international journal, and encouraged me to submit it to the Journal of Ecology. This break with protocol required lengthy negotiations with the department, but in the end they allowed me to submit the paper to the journal. FIGURE 3.1: Proteas growing in the fynbos. The fynbos is a fire dependent vegetation, but if fires dont burn frequently enough, proteas like these become tall and woody. 3.1 Submitting the manuscript Things were very different in those days. Everything was done on hard copies, and we used the postal service to submit and receive documents. Receipt was acknowledged with postcards. Manuscripts were prepared with a device called a typewriter, and figures had to be prepared by hand using graphic artists and manufactured sheets of typefaces and other elements (e.g. Letraset) that were transferred manually to the artwork. Once my manuscript on the effects of fire frequency on fynbos biomass was ready, I placed it (and three additional copies to be posted on to reviewers) all into an envelope, stuck stamps on it, and posted it off to England. If I could have held my breath and kept my fingers crossed for the next three months, I would have done so. Eventually, a large manilla envelope, festooned with British stamps and addressed to Doctor BW van Wilgen appeared in my postbox. In it was a covering letter from the editor handling the manuscript, who said that the journal may be interested in publishing the paper, provided that rather a lot of changes were made to bring the paper up to a standard that they would be happy with. Accompanying this was a copy of the manuscript with corrections indicated in pen. Some words were crossed out, others were added, and words or parts of sentences were ringed, with arrows showing where they should be moved to new positions. When I looked at this, I could see that the editor obviously knew their stuff, and that they had done one heck of a lot to improve my grammar, syntax and logic. I very carefully attended to all of this, prepared a new manuscript, and posted it back to England. This time, only two months passed before another envelope arrived in my postbox. It was another painstakingly marked-up version of my manuscript, with a cover letter expressing appreciation for my clumsy attempts to improve the paper, and requesting a further round of corrections. I worked through all of this again, and prepared a marked-up version for the typist to attend to. The typist indicated that it would have to go into the queue of other work, and that they would not be able to realistically get to it before the end of next week. I was appalled at this delay. I then, somewhat foolishly, decided to re-type the manuscript myself to speed things up. This was a painstaking process, as I had no training. I had to search for each letter on the keyboard before hitting the lever that imprinted the letter onto the paper. I used the two index fingers on both hands to do this, which made me look like a chicken pecking at seeds on the ground (it is a technique I use to this day, much to the amusement of my colleagues, but I am a little faster now). Of course, any mistake you made meant that you had to start the whole page over again. Needless to say, the typist cleared their backlog before I was halfway done, and rapidly completed the job for me. Another round of review followed, and this time the manuscript was returned requiring further, but much less extensive, changes. These I attended to, and received by return of post a letter saying that the handling editor was happy with the paper, and would now pass it on to the Editor-in-Chief for a final decision. To my dismay, another marked-up version appeared in my post box about a month later. Further edits were required. The editor also wanted the title of the article to change from effects of fire frequency to effects of post-fire age, saying that it was with consternation that he noted that this rather fundamental point had not yet been picked up. He also told me to remove a figure, in which I had drawn curved lines through three data points showing how live biomass first increased, and then decreased, with increasing post-fire age, while at the same time the mass of dead material increased at first gradually, the exponentially. He told me that my carefully-prepared figure owed more to art than to science, so I replaced it with a description. After this, my paper was accepted in the Journal of Ecology, and finally appeared in print one and a half years after the first submission: van Wilgen (Van Wilgen 1982). FIGURE 3.2: Brian van Wilgen collecting plot data in the fynbos, 1978. This recently burned plot of fynbos is dominated by proteas (front left) that are all very small. 3.2 Looking back I was immensely proud of this paper. I had managed to get published in a leading international journal, and I was on my way to becoming a real scientist. This was thanks in no small part to some quality editing on the part of the journal, something that is not always the case today. More importantly, the process had taught me lessons that have stood me in good stead ever since. These included the importance of saying what was necessary in as few words as possible, and how to structure a logical progression from introduction, through methods and results to discussion. Most of all, it taught me the importance of attention to detail. Researchers in the 21st century have constant access to word processors, graphics packages for preparing figures, statistical packages for analyzing data, and online access to published papers. While all of this has made it so much easier to write and produce papers, it also makes it easy to cut corners and sometimes to become sloppy. When you can simply add, delete or move a sentence without having to retype the whole page (or add a paragraph without having to retype the rest of the manuscript), you could inadvertently make things worse. My advice would always be to spend additional time getting things as close to perfect the first time around. It will increase the chances of your paper getting a positive reception, and in the long run save time in the revision stages.
